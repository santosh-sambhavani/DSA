### Problem Recap:
- You have **n candies**.
- You want to distribute them among **3 children**.
- Each child can get **at most `limit` candies**.
- Find the total number of ways to do this.

---

- So any child can have at max `limit` candies. and considering `(totalCandies > limit)` is possible
  - Any child can have candies in the range of `0 -> min(totalCandies, limit)`
- So we will iterate over the range of `0 -> min(totalCandies, limit)` for first child's possble candies
- than we can calculate the min number of possible candies for second & max number of possible candies third child 
  & than we can get total count from that.

  ```
    totalPossibleArrangements = maxForThird - minForSecond + 1
  ```
